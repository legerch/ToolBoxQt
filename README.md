# 2. How to build

This library can be use as an _embedded library_ in a subdirectory of your project (like a _git submodule_ for example) :
1. In the **root** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
add_subdirectory(toolboxqt) # Or if library is put in a folder "deps" : add_subdirectory(deps/toolboxqt)
```

1. In the **application/library** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
# Link needed libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE toolboxqt)
```

# 3. How to use

Library is separated according to _Qt modules_, current modules and classes are (for each classes, more details can be found in their own documentation):
- **core:**
  - _RichLink:_ Used to manage an URL with a custom display
- **widgets:**
  - Buttons:
    - _BtnAbstractWordWrap:_ Virtual class which define an interface allowing to properly wrap text of a button
    - _BtnTool:_ Inherit from _QToolButton_ and _BtnAbstractWordWrap_
    - _BtnPush:_ Inherit from _QPushButton_ and _BtnAbstractWordWrap_. Also add _double-click_ event support.
  - _LabelScl:_ Custom class which inherit from _QLabel_ class and properly scale image or animations to the label size.

To use a class, simply use the proper include:
```cpp
#include "toolboxqt/widgets/labelscl.h"
```

All classes are defined inside namespace `tbq` (for _ToolBoxQt_).

# 5. Documentation

All classes has been documented with [Doxygen][doxygen-official] utility, documentation can be generated by using:
```shell
# Run documentation generation
doxygen ./Doxyfile

# Under Windows OS, maybe doxygen is not added to the $PATH
"C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin\doxygen.exe" ./Doxyfile
```
> **Note:** You can also load the _Doxyfile_ into _Doxywizard_ (Doxygen GUI) and run generation.
